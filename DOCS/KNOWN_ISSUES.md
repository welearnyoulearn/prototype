### [#116] Syllabus Translate relies on Google's undocumented Input Tools endpoint
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Detail:** `GET /api/transliterate` proxies `inputtools.google.com`, which has no published quota, SLA, pricing or API terms. Google can throttle or block it at any time, and on Vercel all schools share the same outbound IPs.
- **Workaround:** If it fails, teachers see "Translate is unavailable right now" and can still type the name directly (or use a phone keyboard with Telugu/Hindi).
- **Status:** Acceptable for prototype. Before production, swap in Azure Translator's Transliterate API (supports Latin → Telugu and Latin → Devanagari; free tier 2M chars/month, then ~$10 per million) behind the same route. No client change needed.
